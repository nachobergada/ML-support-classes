Classes that help deal with ML projects

During my different ML projects, I always try to standarize as many things as possible, specially when dealing with the EDA and validation tasks. I have created this repository to keep track of these pieces of code and be able to reuse and improve them. Feel free to use them if you find them interesting.

GridSearchCVResults: is a class that helps visualize the results of a GridSearchCV process. GridSearchCV does not take care about overfitting or underfitting, and just selects the model with the best test metric, no matter if there are significant differences between test and train.
